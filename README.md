## Moin! 👋 I'm Lukas

At [plentymarkets](https://www.plentymarkets.eu), I lead the development and maintenance of our cutting-edge cloud infrastructure. I lead multiple teams of skilled software engineers, driving innovation and ensuring scalable, efficient, and maintainable solutions. My passion for backend engineering and leadership helps bring out the best in my teams as we build systems that support the company's evolving needs.

## In addition to my day job

I am also a committed open source contributor. Some of my notable contributions include:

- Main external contributor to [yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/), where I have added percentage-based sizing and fixed a lot of layout bugs, making the library more flexible and reliable 💪.
- Proud contributor to [symmetric-ds](https://github.com/jumpmind/symmetric-ds/), an open-source project that provides database replication and synchronization 🔄.
- Maintainer of [PyViCare](https://github.com/somm15/PyViCare/), a Python library for managing heating devices from Viessmann 🔥.

Aside from my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and collaborator 🤝. I enjoy working with others to find creative solutions to complex problems.

## When I'm not coding 💻 or leading my teams

You'll find me spending quality time with my family and son ❤️ or ride my bike 🚴‍♂️.
