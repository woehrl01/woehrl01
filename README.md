### Moin! 👋 I'm Lukas

A software engineering manager and backend engineer with a passion for writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.
At plentymarkets, I am responsible for the development and maintenance of the company's cloud platform and I lead a group of talented software engineers.

### In addition to my day job

I am also a committed open source contributor. Some of my notable contributions include:

- Main external contributor to [yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/), where I have added percentage-based sizing and fixed a lot of layout bugs, making the library more flexible and reliable 💪.
- Proud contributor to [symmetric-ds](https://github.com/jumpmind/symmetric-ds/), an open-source project that provides database replication and synchronization 🔄.
- Maintainer of [PyViCare](https://github.com/somm15/PyViCare/), a Python library for managing heating devices from Viessmann 🔥.
Aside from my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and collaborator 🤝. I enjoy working with others to find creative solutions to complex problems.

### When I'm not coding 💻 or leading my teams

You'll find me spending quality time with my family and son ❤️ or ride my bike 🚴‍♂️.
